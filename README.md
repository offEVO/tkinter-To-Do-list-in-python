___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This code is a To-Do list that remembers everything previously saved and stores it as a file.

In the main code file, you will see the code required for the application to work. It's pretty straightforward from there, but there is one thing you WILL NEED:


You must make a "tasks" txt file spelled exactly like this. This text document must be in the same file directory as the code. This is so it can access the file and save the previously stored information.

We can use the python installer "PIP" to install the necessary library's

From there all you should need to do is past the code in to the code editor of choice:

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Some of the features Consist of:
_________________________________________________
- An add task button
- A remove task feature
- I also made sure the window was not resizable, when the resize button is clickes it pins it's self the the uppermost corner of the User's screen, This isn't really a feautre but more a small detail ü§è

 - In the future I may compile this to c+ and publish it as a desktop application
- When multiple tasks are set in the to do list, I made sure to add the ability to scroll with a trackpad or scroll wheel.
