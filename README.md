# tkinter-To-Do-list-in-python
This code is a To-Do list that remembers everything previously saved and stores it as a file, for you to be able to edit in the to-do list application.

In the main code file, you will see the code required for the application to work. It's pretty straightforward from there, but there is one thing you WILL NEED:

You must make a "tasks" spelled like this. This text document must be in the same file as the code. This is so it can access the file and save the previously stored information.

From there all you should need to do is past the code in to the code editor of choice:
